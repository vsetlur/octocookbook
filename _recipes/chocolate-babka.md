tags: bread, dessert, sweets

ingredients:
- 2 packages (about 4½ tsp.) active dry yeast
- 1/2 c. warm water (about 100 F)
- 2/3 c. warm milk (about 100F)
- 1/3 c. sugar
- 1/2 tsp. salt
- 1/2 tsp. vanilla extract
- 3 Tbsp. (3/8 stick) butter or margarine, softened
- 4 1/2 to 5 c. flour
- 3 eggs
- 1/3 c. unsweetened cocoa (I prefer Droste brand)
- 2/3 c. sugar
- 3 Tbsp. (3/8 stick) butter or margarine, melted
- 1 c. coarsely chopped walnuts (optional - I never use these)
- 2 Tbsp. (¼ stick) butter or margarine, softened
- ¼ tsp. ground cinnamon
- 1/3 c. confectioner’s sugar
- ¼ c. flour


directions:
- Sprinkle yeast over the water in large bowl of electric mixer. Let stand until yeast is soft (about 5 minutes).
- Warm the milk to about 100°F. It should be warm to the touch but not so hot you can’t touch it.
- Add the sugar, milk, salt, vanilla, and the softened butter.
- Add 2½ cups of the flour. Mix to blend then beat at medium speed until smooth and elastic (about 5 minutes).
- Separate one of the eggs; reserve white for glaze. Beat in egg yolk and whole eggs, one at a time.
- Stir in about 1½ cups more flour to make soft dough.
- Turn dough out onto a board or pastry cloth coated with some of the remaining ½ to 1 cup flour. Knead until dough is smooth and satiny and small bubbles form just under surface (10 to 12 minutes), adding just enough flour to prevent dough from being sticky.
- Turn dough in a greased bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and a towel; let rise in a warm place until doubled in bulk (45 minutes to 1 hour).
- While the dough is rising, make the filling.  In a small bowl mix cocoa and sugar until well combined and no lumps remain.
- Punch dough down. Cover with inverted bowl and let rest for 10 minutes.
- Divide dough in half. Roll each half out on a floured surface to a 10- by 20-inch rectangle. Brush half of the melted butter over each rectangle of dough, leaving about a ½-inch margin on all edges. Sprinkle half of the cocoa / sugar mixture evenly over buttered surface of each rectangle. Sprinkle each rectangle with half of the nuts if you use them.
- Starting with a long side, roll each rectangle of dough tightly, jelly-roll fashion. Pinch edge to seal.
- Zigzag each roll back and forth to fit into a well-greased 4½ - by 8½-inch loaf pan. This recipe tends to stick. Do not stint on greasing the pan!
- Let rise until almost doubled in bulk (35 to 45 minutes). Preheat oven to 350°F.
- While the dough is rising, in a medium bowl beat butter with cinnamon until fluffy.
- Gradually beat in sugar.
- Mix in flour by hand until crumbly and uniformly combined.
- Beat reserved egg white with 1 tsp water and brush over loaves. Sprinkle each loaf with half of the topping.
- Bake until well browned (30 to 35 minutes). Carefully remove loaves from pans and let cool on wire racks.

Makes 2 standard size loaf pans.

This recipe uses softened butter. Make sure you take a stick out ahead of time because
it’s hard to do with butter from a fridge or freezer!
