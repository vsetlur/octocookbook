tags: bread

ingredients:
- 3 ⅔ cups (550g) bread flour
- 2 ½ teaspoons active dry yeast
- 1 ½ teaspoons kosher salt
- 1 tablespoon sugar
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 10 ounces warm water (110 degrees)
- 2 tablespoons baking soda
- Optional garnish: poppy seeds, sesame seeds, etc.


directions:
- In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook, add the flour, yeast, salt, sugar, and oil.  Turn the mixer onto its lowest speed, then drizzle only 10 ounces of the warm water down the side of the bowl.  Watch until the water is completely incorporated, using an additional 2 ounces of water only if you need it to create a ‘clean’ bowl.  The dough will climb the hook. 
- Kick the mixer up to its next speed and continue to mix for 7 minutes.  Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 425 degrees and bring a large pot of water and the 2 tablespoons baking soda to a boil.  
- Remove the hook, shape the dough into a ball and put it back into the bowl.  Cover with a towel or plastic wrap.  Let dough rise for 15 minutes.
- Once the dough has risen, knead it on an unfloured board, then roll the dough - which should feel springy to your touch - into a 16-inch log.  Cut into 12 equal pieces.
- One by one, roll each into a 10-inch ‘snake’ then form a bagel by overlapping the ends by an inch or two, putting three or four fingers through the hole and gently rolling the overlap to create a circle.
- Boil the bagels in three batches (of four each).  They should float immediately.  Boil for 15 seconds, flip and boil for another 15 seconds (30 seconds total).  
- Using a large perforated ladle or wire skimmer, remove to a wire cooling rack to briefly ‘drip dry.’  Sprinkle your garnish (if using) on the bagels while they are still wet.
- Place bagels on a parchment=covered baking sheet and bake 25 to 30 minutes until golden brown.  Cool before slicing.

I’ve been making bagels to make up for missing bagel friday.  I use a recipe that I grabbed from the Seattle Times Magazine many years ago (‘Nancy’s make ‘em quick bagels’).  I use Trader Joe’s ‘everything but the bagel’ seasoning on them.  

These freeze well.  We just take them out of the freezer the night before we want to have them for breakfast and they are thawed and ready for toasting in the morning.
