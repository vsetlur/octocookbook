My husband ate a ‘cookies and cream’ cookie somewhere and thought it was the best cookie ever.  So, I improvised and these are now his favorite… it’s just my standard oatmeal cookie recipe with chocolate chips replaced with crushed up oreos.  It feels a bit insane to crush up cookies to put inside cookies, but now we’re all addicted to them.
