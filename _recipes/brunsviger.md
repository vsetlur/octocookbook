image: brunsviger.jpg
tags: cake, sweets, yeasted bread

ingredients:
- 250ml / 8 oz milk (warm, 100F)
- 7g active dry yeast
- 120g / 4oz (1 stick) butter, at room temperature
- 4 Tbsp sugar
- 1 tsp salt
- 2 eggs
- 500 g / 4 cups + a little bit of flour
- 150g / 5 oz butter 
- 250 g / 9oz brown sugar
- 2 T cinnamon


directions:
- Pour milk into bowl of a stand mixer.  Dissolve yeast in the milk.
- Add 1 stick butter, the 4 Tbsp sugar, 1 tsp salt, 2 eggs, and flour.
- Knead with dough hook at medium speed until smooth and shiny (8-12 minutes)
- Butter a 9x13 baking pan
- Spread the dough out into the pan, cover it, and let it rise until double in size (40-60 min)
- Preheat the oven to 400F
- While the oven heats, make the topping - combine the 150g butter, brown sugar, and cinnamon in a pan and heat until melted
- Uncover the risen dough and press your fingers down into the dough to make a bunch of divots where the melted topping will pool
- Pour the melted topping onto the dough
- If you want to be cautious, put the baking dish on a baking tray with edges in case it bubbles over
- Bake the cake until cooked through - probably 20 minutes

From a friend that encouraged me to spend some quarantine trying out 'Nordic recipes.'  This Danish cake is in honor of my Danish godmother who will turn 103 years old next month (Sept 2020).
