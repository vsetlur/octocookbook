title:  "pizza dough"
image: pizza-dough.jpg
tags: pizza, dough, bread

ingredients:
- 300 ml warm water (100F)
- 7g active dry yeast (or, if you're doing a long rise in the fridge, maybe 4g)
- 500g bread flour 
- 10g kosher salt
- 15ml olive oil (1 Tb)


directions:
- Mix yeast and water in the bowl of a stand mixer.  Let it sit for about 5 minutes.
- Add flour, salt, and olive oil.  Mix with the dough hook.
- When everything is mixed, knead with the mixer at medium speed for about 7 minutes or so, until the dough is firm and stretchy (aka, "looks about right")
- If you're going to use same day, let it rise in an oiled bowl for about 2 hours until it's doubled in size.  
- ...If you are letting it rise overnight (or longer) in the fridge, put it in a large, oiled, covered container and tuck it away in the fridge.  Take it out about three hours before you want to use it, divide it and then continue on with the instructions...
- After the dough has risen, divide it into three or four equal pieces.  Let them rise for another 30 min or so until they are roughly doubled in size again.  Dividing into four pieces will make approx. 12 inch pizzas.
- Stretch out the dough and cook with it!

We make a lot of pizza.  This recipe has served us well.  If you think it's time to invest in a cool, portable outdoor pizza oven let me know.  I'm a huge fan of my Ooni. It burns wood pellets, heats to something crazy like 900 degrees, and cooks a pizza in 60-90 seconds.
